<h3>This repository have the code and analysis used during the challanges of Super Data Science SQL & Database Design A-Z course.</h3>

<h4>Challenge One:</h4>

<ul>From the database provided you will:
  <li>How many complaints were received and sent on the same day;</li>
<li>Extract the complaints received in New York;</li>
<li>Extract the complaints received in the states of New York and California;</li>
<li>Extract all the rows with the word "credit" in the product;</li>
<li>Extract all the rows with the word "late" in the issue field.</li>
</ul>

For the first challenge item i decided to do something more interative so, for that i did the following query on Tableau 10.5
SELECT company, product_name, issue
FROM consumer_complaints
WHERE date_sent = date_received

After that i created a Dashboar so the user can not only see how many complaints were done, but also control which company, product and type of issue that was rceived.
