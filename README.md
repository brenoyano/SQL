<h3>This repository have the code and analysis used during the challanges of Super Data Science SQL & Database Design A-Z course.</h3>

<h4>Challenge One:</h4>

<ul>From the database provided you will:
  <li>How many complaints were received and sent on the same day;</li>
<li>Extract the complaints received in New York;</li>
<li>Extract the complaints received in the states of New York and California;</li>
<li>Extract all the rows with the word "credit" in the product;</li>
<li>Extract all the rows with the word "late" in the issue field.</li>
</ul>

For the first challenge item i decided to do something more interative so, for that i did the following query on Tableau 10.5
SELECT company, product_name, issue
FROM consumer_complaints
WHERE date_sent = date_received

After that i created a Dashboar so the user can not only see how many complaints were done, but also control which company, product and type of issue that was rceived.

If you want to see this dashboard and interect with it you can access it by clicking <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/brenoyano#!/vizhome/SQLChallenge/Painel1">Here</a> 


The second and third part (Extract the complaints received in New York / new york and california) were also simple because the only diference was that in WHERE were used state_name = 'NY' and WHERE = state_name = 'NY' OR state name = 'CA'
SELECT company, product_name, issue, state_name
FROM consumer_complaints
WHERE state_name = 'NY' OR state_name = 'CA'

For the fourth and fifth part was used wild cards.
SELECT company, product_name, issue, state_name
FROM consumer_complaints
WHERE LOWER(product_name) LIKE '%credit%'

SELECT company, product_name, issue, state_name
FROM consumer_complaints
WHERE LOWER(issue) LIKE '%late%'
